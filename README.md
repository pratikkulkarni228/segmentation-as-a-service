# Semantic Segmentation as a Service
#### A project that aims at building a Semantic Image Segmentation model and depoying it as a service.

Semantic image segmentation, the task of assigning a semantic label, such as “road”, “sky”, “person”, “dog”, to every pixel in an image. 
The project is based on Google's [Deeplab](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab) project which has also enabled numerous new applications, such as the synthetic shallow depth-of-field effect shipped in the portrait mode of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones and mobile real-time video segmentation-[source](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/semantic-image-segmentation-with.html).
The dataset used here is a well known autonomous drving dataset called [CityScapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)
